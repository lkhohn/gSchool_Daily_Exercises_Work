// -Learn a statically/strictly typed language like Java, C Sharp or C++
// -Always be the least smartest person on your team. If you are the smartest, you become too lazy and cocky
//
//
// -Develop a strong plan for your employment
// -what are you working on right now? how many hours will you work on this?
// -how many jobs are you going to apply for?
// -reading tech blogs or twitter
// -practicing tech interview questions
// -even if you are getting a 3rd or 4th interview, keep applying
// -if rejected, can always ask 'what are you looking for? how can I improve as a candidate?"
