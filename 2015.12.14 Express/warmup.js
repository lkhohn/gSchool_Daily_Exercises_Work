// Kewl Interpreter
//
// For some more practice with the filesystem module, we'll spend some time creating a simple interpreter.
// An interpreter is a set of instructions that reads and handles code. Our interpreter will be simple and only handle one command - print.
// Follow the instructions in this document to create an interpreter for the kewl.js file.
//
// After completing the basic interpreter, follow the instructions so that print takes parentheses and then so that some characters are escaped.
// (Escaping a character just means that it's special meaning is ignored and the character is just output.)
